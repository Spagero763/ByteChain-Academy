    description:
      'Bitcoin is the world\'s first decentralized cryptocurrency, introduced in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto through a whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." It operates on a public blockchain ledger secured by a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, where miners compete to validate transactions and earn newly minted BTC as rewards. With a hard-capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often referred to as "digital gold" due to its scarcity and store-of-value properties. It has inspired thousands of subsequent cryptocurrencies and fundamentally changed how the world thinks about money, trust, and financial sovereignty.',

      'Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and a team of co-founders. It introduced programmable smart contracts, enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) without relying on intermediaries. Ether (ETH) is the native currency used to pay for computation on the network, commonly referred to as "gas." In 2022, Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake via "The Merge," dramatically reducing its energy consumption. Ethereum hosts the majority of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and Layer-2 scaling solutions, making it the backbone of the modern decentralized web ecosystem.',

The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) enables quick transaction finality without the energy costs of proof-of-work mining. Stellar's native token, Lumens (XLM), is used to pay transaction fees and maintain accounts on the network.

It powers the BNB Chain ecosystem, which includes BNB Smart Chain (BSC), a high-throughput blockchain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. BNB is used to pay trading fees on Binance at a discount, participate in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and fuel transactions on BNB Chain. Binance periodically burns BNB tokens to reduce the total supply, creating deflationary pressure. With a vibrant DeFi ecosystem and millions of active users, BNB has become one of the most widely used utility tokens in the crypto industry.",

With a maximum supply of 84 million coins, Litecoin was designed to handle a higher volume of transactions. It was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the Lightning Network.
